         <h1>Advice on Weight Loss</h1>
         <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Weight loss is usually most effective when it focuses on long-term healthy habits rather than quick fixes. A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains can help support steady progress while still giving your body the nutrients it needs. Reducing sugary drinks, highly processed foods and large portion sizes can also make a big difference. Staying consistent and setting realistic goals is important, as healthy weight loss takes time.

Regular physical activity plays a key role alongside healthy eating. Aim for a mix of cardio and strength-based exercise, even if it starts with simple activities like walking more each day. Drinking enough water, getting good sleep and managing stress can also support weight management. It’s important to listen to your body and avoid extreme diets, and if you have any health conditions or concerns, consider speaking with a healthcare professional before making major lifestyle changes.</h2>
